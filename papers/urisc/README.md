# the Ultimate RISC

This is my final year undergraduate paper from 1989; the formal specification and implementation of a microprocessor which implemented one instruction, MOVE. The specification was done in a version of Standard ML which allowed for the specification of temporal logic, yet allowed pure ML to be used, ML which could then be interpreted. The ALU was so defined, then translated to FPGA form. The rest of the system was built from 74-series ICs and hand-wired.
