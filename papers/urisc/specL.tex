A few functions had to be added so that the following files could be parsed by either Lambda or ML.
A different copy of this file is used in the simulation which can not use Church' s iota function.
\begin{verbatim}
(* Spec.L	1.4
   ======
Special stuff put in to the Lambda specification alone  to make it more ML like
10/1/89 sal *)
fun not a=~a;
(* definition of successor-15 function avoiding binary maths *)
fun S15 i =
        if i == Maxint15 then Zero15 else
                iota j. Int15toNat j == S(Int15toNat i);

(* definition of successor-32 function avoiding binary maths *)
fun S32 i =
        if i == Maxint32 then Zero32 else
                iota j. Int32toNat j == S(Int32toNat i);
(* define time as measured in nanoSeconds*)
val nS=Natural;
\end{verbatim}
