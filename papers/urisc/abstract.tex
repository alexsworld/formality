\begin{abstract}
Computer Design is a highly competitive field, where there is much  interest in the 
possibility of designing high performance computers quickly, cheaply and reliably.
The cost and performance requirements may be satisfied by RISC architectures, and the application
of Formal Methods to hardware design promises new levels of quality.
This report is a description of a final year project, the design, formal specification and implementation of the Ultimate RISC, a single instruction computer. 

The project was a demonstration that such a computer is simple enough to be  designed and built within a single year, although
the implementation does suffer from some limitations.

The concept of a single instruction computer is  discussed in general,
concluding that whilst it is a fast and compact design which could be useful in some applications the memory bandwidth it requires  limits its performance.
