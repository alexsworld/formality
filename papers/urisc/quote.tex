       A good artist can create fine art with crayons or oil paints (or
whatever).  Assembly languages are definitely the crayons of the computer
world.  RISCs are kind of like the little box of Crayolas with 16 colors,
a CISC, like the VAX, is like the big box with 64.  Ever notice how it was
that the black, red and blue crayons always ended up the smallest in that
big box and the mauve crayon looked brand new?
