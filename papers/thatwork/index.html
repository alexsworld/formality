It approaches this problem in both software process and in the specifics
of some areas of a Web Service -such as API, security and session
management. The software process is more foundational: this paper argues
that the traditional waterfall model of deployment is not appropriate
for Web Services. In these services, integration with external callers is
one of the key problems, yet this only surfaces on live systems.
Debugging on, and rapid updates of, the live system are the only way to
address interoperability and other problems that surface on the
production service. Furthermore, as management of a running system is
the main ongoing cost of a service, the needs of operations cannot be
left as an afterthought to the system design.
<p>

We propose the incorporation of the deployment process into the
iterative development process through the inclusion of operations use
cases, tests and defect tracking into the normal software cycle. When
combined with a fully automated deployment mechanism, the foundations
for a rapid web service development process are in place.
<p>

On the technical aspects of Web Service development, there are core
issues related to security, interoperability, scalability and robust
design that need to be considered from the outset. We explore these
topics using the experience gained from encountering many of the issues
when developing production systems. We then go on to explore how the
component models of the future could adapt to better suit server-side
and Web Service development. We argue that uniform APIs for standard
services -logging, configuration, management, testing- permit
reusable components to be used in a production server environment.
We discuss how neither of the two platforms competing most vociferously to be the
foundation upon which developers should build their services, 
Enterprise Java and Microsoft .NET, have room for improvement in this
area, and propose some strategies for improvement. 
<p>

Finally, this paper explores the concept that individual Web Services
will become independent components within the emerging Web Service
Federation; the collection of independent systems interworking using
common Web Service protocols. As these protocols evolve they may become
viable to connect programs and computers inside an individual Web
Service, although this is only partially viable today.
